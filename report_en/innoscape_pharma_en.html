<p>The Swiss pharmaceutical sector has a major impact on Switzerland’s economy and the well-being of its citizens in general. It is a true example of a world-class innovation hub and is one of the industry’s global leaders when it comes to R&amp;D activities. Nonetheless, one of the concerns - often pointed out in public - is whether the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland will be able to overcome the rising challenges of the vibrant environment in which it operates and will be able to retain its top position in the future. With this in mind, we revisit how it has evolved and discuss its current importance for the whole economy, laying ground for our upcoming set of analyses on the innovation capacities of Swiss pharmaceutical firms in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Steady increase of pharmaceutical jobs</strong>: Data is taken from <a href = https://ilostat.ilo.org/data/ target = “_blank”>ILOSTAT</a> database. Employment data comes from local labor force surveys which cover only the resident population. This means that the employment figures do not cover cross-border commuters. In addition, given that an employed person may hold several jobs, employment refers to his or her primary job only. Finally, this data covers all persons of working age who, during a specified, brief period, were either in paid employment or self-employed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pharma’s growing importance for the Swiss economy</strong>: Data on gross value added is from <a href = https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/catalogues-databases/tables.assetdetail.14347536.html target = “_blank”>Switzerland’s Federal Statistical Office (FSO)</a> - Industries production account database.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swiss pharma is highly productive</strong>: Data on gross value added is similar as before. In addition, we used labor force survey data on the number of employees from <a href = https://ilostat.ilo.org/data/ target = “_blank”>ILOSTAT</a> database; firms survey data on the number of jobs from <a href = https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/en/px-x-0602000000_101/px-x-0602000000_101/px-x-0602000000_101.px target = “_blank”>FSO</a>; and data on cross-border workers from <a href = https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/de/px-x-0302010000_106/px-x-0302010000_106/px-x-0302010000_106.px target = “_blank”>FSO</a> database. The <a href = https://www.media-stat.admin.ch/web/apps/glossary/index.php?n=glo-165-en target = “_blank”>FSO</a> defines a job as follows: “The term “jobs” refers to all positions of employment that are filled. While largely covering the same concept, “jobs” and “employed persons” do not always coincide, given that an employed person may hold several jobs. In such cases, the employed person holds one primary job and one or more secondary jobs". In addition, ILO data on employment covers only the residents, given that this data is collected via local labor force surveys. We utilize these differences to create three distinct labor productivity indicators, primarily by assuming that ILO employment data represents a good approximation for jobs held by Swiss residents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exporting to every corner of the world</strong>: Data on exported goods is taken from the <a href = https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=STANI4_2020 target = “_blank”>OECD</a>. Exports are measured using freight on board valuation methodology and are adjusted for re-export values (whenever possible). <em>Values in million USD</em> show the Swiss pharmaceutical exports in current US dollars to a given partner country. The indicator <em>% of total Swiss exports to the destination</em> represents the share of Swiss pharmaceutical exports in total Swiss goods exports to a given partner country and <em>% of total Swiss pharma exports</em> represents the share of Swiss pharmaceutical exports to each partner country in total Swiss pharmaceutical exports.</p></li>

<p>Today, the pharmaceutical industry directly employs around 33’000 individuals with permanent residency in Switzerland. Furthermore, around 7,000 cross-border commuters work in the Swiss pharmaceutical sector. The interactive graph below illustrates absolute and relative employment figures in the pharmaceutical industry across different countries. Although the absolute numbers may seem to be low, the share of employees in the Swiss pharmaceutical sector in total number of employed individuals is twice those of the USA, Germany, France or Italy. Interestingly, the share of employment in the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland is similar to Belgium, but the Swiss workers are creating a much higher economic impact than their Belgian colleagues. This suggests extraordinarily high productivity levels of workers in the Swiss pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>Even with rather “low” numbers of employed persons, the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland is generating an immense added value for the Swiss economy. This implies a very high level of labor productivity relative to other manufacturing industries (even taking into account the large number of cross-border commuters employed in the sector). Hence, in recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed substantially to the wellbeing of the Swiss, accounting for more than 5% of the total gross value added (GVA) in the economy (see <a href = https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/catalogues-databases/tables.assetdetail.14347536.html target = “_blank”>Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland, FSO</a>). However, the true rise of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry began only after the year 2000, when it overtook two other big Swiss industries – the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products, which also includes the world-famous Swiss watches, and the manufacture of machinery and equipment.</p>

<p>The fact that less than 1% of the labor force generates more than 5% of Switzerland’s total value added is remarkable and deserves more attention. Obviously, the following question arises: How dependent on foreign workers is the Swiss pharmaceutical sector’s high productivity, especially on cross-border commuters? In order to illustrate this, we present three productivity estimates that use different definitions of the number of employees: (a) workers with residence in Switzerland, (b) total number of jobs and (c) workers with residence in Switzerland + cross-border commuters. We define the labor productivity for each sector as the GVA in CHF per worker.</p>
<p>The labor productivity in the pharmaceutical sector varies heavily, depending on the definition of workers used. Taking into account the cross-border commuters, the productivity estimates drop by roughly 30% and when considering the total number of jobs, it drops by nearly 40% compared to calculations based on the Swiss residents only. This highlights the fact that the Swiss pharmaceutical industry’s performance is substantially dependent on access to the foreign labor force. This result also coincides with another of our analyses within the Innoscape Project on the <a href = https://innoscape.ch/en/publications/cross-border-commuting-and-inventions-made-in-switzerland target = “_blank”> Importance of cross-border commuters for inventions ‘Made in Switzerland’</a>. However, regardless of the indicator used, the labor productivity of the pharmaceutical industry is by far the highest among Swiss manufacturing sectors.</p>

<h2><strong>The market for pharmaceuticals is global</strong></h2>
<p><br></p>
<p>Access to skilled labor from abroad is important, but free international trade may be even more significant for the growth of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry. The market for pharmaceutical products is global and the home-market is limited in its size. Thus, Swiss pharmaceutical firms are required to nurture their export activities. Although Swiss pharmaceutical export figures have been rising steadily in the last 30 years, there are some potential caveats concerning these export trends. For example, back in 1990, pharmaceutical products comprised less than 10% of the total Swiss exports to most destinations. Yet, in 2019 the share of pharmaceutical exports made up almost 30% of the total exported goods in most of the destination countries, making the overall Swiss export performance increasingly dependent on a single sector (for a deeper investigation of potential risks associated with such an increased export concentration, see our report for the SECO in German language <a href = https://cieb.unibas.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/cieb/SECO_Strukturberichterstattung-2017_Nr-56_Band-1_Frankenaufwertung_und_Exportstruktur.pdf target = “_blank”>CIEB, 2017</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the geographical dispersion of export destinations is also changing. In 1990 around 8% of total Swiss pharmaceutical exports went to the USA, while in 2019 this share was roughly 26%. On the one hand, a larger export orientation towards the USA (and Germany) could produce certain concentration risks. But on the other hand, it may reveal important geographical innovation patterns and collaborations in facilitating new approaches in future research. In other words, the flow of pharmaceutical products may trail the flow of knowledge (more on this topic in our report on international research collaborations - coming out soon). Irrespective of this geographic pattern, the question generally arises as to whether the Swiss pharmaceutical industry`s extraordinary success story can be continued in the future. This depends to a large extent on its innovation activities, which is what we will discuss in what follows.</p>

<h2><strong>Swiss Pharma: A world class innovator</strong></h2>
<p><br></p>
<p>“The core task of research-based pharmaceutical companies is to combat disease by developing innovative medicinal products and to make these medicines available to patients as quickly as possible” <a href = https://www.interpharma.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low_interpharma_broschure_A4_rz_en_DS_compressed.pdf target = “_blank”>(Interpharma, p.9)</a>. Hence, innovation is key in the pharmaceutical sector. Moreover, protecting intellectual property through patents is an important aspect of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry’s R&amp;D activities. According to Severin Schwan (CEO of Roche), without patents there would be no innovation in the pharmaceutical sector (Interview in <a href =  https://www.adlittle.com/sites/default/files/prism/Interview_with_Severin_Schwan.pdf target = “_blank”>Prism, 2013</a>). In the scientific literature, patents are often used as a proxy for innovation and as a metric for deriving knowledge flows, an aspect which we will cover later in this report. Even though patents are, of course, an imperfect measure, they still represent a standardized indicator in evaluating knowledge diffusions and innovation effectiveness of an economy (for a recent literature survey, please see: <a href = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obes.12365 target = “_blank”>Arvanitis, Seliger and Wörter, 2020</a>).</p>
<p>The Swiss pharmaceutical sector is often denoted as “one of the most important centers of pharmaceutical research worldwide, with a reputation that reaches far beyond Europe” (<a href = https://www.interpharma.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/low_interpharma_broschure_A4_rz_en_DS_compressed.pdf target = “_blank”>Interpharma, p.7</a>). However, as one can investigate in the figure below, the number of published patents in the pharmaceutical sector in Switzerland seems to have been slowly losing its pace since 2008, a trend also visible in many other countries. In addition, during the same period the share of pharma patents in total patent applications is also declining, from 17% in 2007 to 7% in 2015. This indicates that, relative to other industries, the Swiss pharmaceutical sector has lost some of its importance for the overall domestic innovation activity. Note, however, that these figures represent patent counts, which are quantitative measures of innovation. In turn, these measures can’t say much about the quality and importance of new inventions in different sectors. Furthermore, and notwithstanding its relative decline, the pharmaceutical sector continues to rank high when it comes to the innovation intensity in total patent applications.</p>

<h5><strong>Patent Counts: the Output of Pharmaceutical R&amp;D</strong></h5>
<div class="box_div">
<details>
<p><summary style="font-size:11pt"><em>Click here for details about patent counts</em></summary></p>
<p>Patent data for US patents is taken from <a href = https://www.patentsview.org/download/ target = “_blank”>patentsview.org</a> (considering data till August 27, 2020) and for EPO patents from the <a href = http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/intellectual-property-statistics-and-analysis.htm target = “_blank”>OECD intellectual property (IP) statistics and analysis database</a> (considering data till January, 2020). Absolute values show pharmaceutical patent counts (applied and granted for EPO patents and only granted for US patents) for each country, whereas the inventor’s residence determines the patent’s geographical affiliation. This is different for Switzerland, where additionally we take into account patents invented by cross-border commuters. For details, see our report on the <a href = https://innoscape.ch/en/publications/cross-border-commuting-and-inventions-made-in-switzerland target = “_blank”> Importance of cross-border commuters for inventions ‘Made in Switzerland’</a>. To assign patents to years, we use a patent’s priority year and limit ourselves to considering only patents up to the priority year 2015 (for a detailed explanation, see the methodology box in <a href = https://innoscape.ch/en/publications/cross-border-commuting-and-inventions-made-in-switzerland/#pat_method target=“_blank”>Importance of cross-border commuters for inventions ‘Made in Switzerland’</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, our patent counts include only the so-called triadic patents. They are registered by all three major patent offices (European Patent Office, Japan Patent Office and the US Patent and Trademark Office) and protect the same invention. By taking such patents into account, home advantage and the influence of geographical locations are significantly reduced. However, our triadic patent counts may differ somewhat from the <a href = https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=PATS_IPC# target = “_blank”> OECD </a> database in absolute values. This is because the OECD dataset is based on patent families while ours includes all distinct patents (i.e., the number of all non-equivalent patents) belonging to a triadic patent family. In the case of inventors coming from different countries, the geographical division is assigned and then summed as shares. For example, if one inventor comes from the USA and the other from Japan, the same patent will be assigned as 0.5 to the USA and 0.5 to Japan (for more information on how to determine the origins of patents see <a href = https://innoscape.ch/en/publications/cross-border-commuting-and-inventions-made-in-switzerland target = “_blank”> Importance of cross-border commuters for inventions ‘Made in Switzerland’</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, the indicator <em>% of total patents</em> represents the share of pharmaceutical patents in total patent applications across each country, <em>RCA of pharma patents</em> represents the so-called “revealed comparative advantage” in patenting pharmaceutical products. It is the share of pharmaceutical patents in total patents of a country divided by the share of worldwide pharmaceutical patents in total patents worldwide. Thus, it represents a measure of international innovativeness of an industry relative to the entire economy of a country.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Switzerland also enjoys a very high revealed comparative advantage (RCA) in creating pharma patents (among the top 10 countries worldwide). The RCA is a measure of the international innovativeness of a country’s specific industry relative to the entire economy. In other words, the high RCA of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry means that Switzerland possesses a particular strength in pharmaceutical innovations compared to the rest of the world. Interestingly, Spain is positioning itself as the world leader according to the RCA index. According to <a href = https://static.scientificamerican.com/wv/assets/2015_SAWorldView.pdf target = “_blank”>Scientific American Worldview</a>, in 2015 Spain ranked 4th globally according to the biotech innovation intensity indicator, which is specifically developed to identify the “outsized” sectoral activity among smaller countries. In this report it is also noted that Spain`s particularly high ranking is due mainly to its immense increase in the number of filed patent applications. Spanish patenting intensity was more resilient to the 2008 crisis than Swiss patenting, implying that in the future we may expect the rise of pharmaceutical industries in other countries, even among those considered to be untraditional pharma hubs. This could make the overall competition in the world healthcare market harsher.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to explore the geographical concentration of innovations in the pharmaceutical industry within a country. For this purpose, you can click on the tab <em>regions</em> in the figure below and investigate the patent applications of the 76 most important pharma clusters worldwide. Not surprisingly, most Swiss innovations in the pharma industry are concentrated in the region of Northwestern Switzerland, with Basel as its center. Indeed, the region of Northwestern Switzerland ranks very high among the world’s most important pharma innovation regions. Being the home to Swiss (and the world’s) pharmaceutical giants - Novartis and Roche, it is a place to be if you are interested in healthcare innovations. Among the most important regions for pharmaceutical research worldwide, Northwestern Switzerland takes the 16th place (according to the patent rankings in 2000), leaving numerous US, Japanese, German and other regions behind. Some other regions in Europe, however, are ahead in terms of absolute numbers of patent applications, but taking into account relative terms and, thus, differences in size across the regions, Northwestern Switzerland ranks number one in Europe as shown by our RCA-index.</p>
<p>Apart from investigating patent activities of countries and regions, the bigger view of continents is also interesting. America (predominantly North America) is still the world leading continent when it comes to the number of filed patent applications in the pharmaceutical sector. In addition, Asia surpassed Europe in 2014 and took its long-held place as the second most important pharma patenting hub, slowly approaching America’s numbers. Looking at the relative indicators, however, another rising-star continent appears on the horizon – Australia and Oceania, which has an extremely large share of pharma patents in its total patents, indicating a high degree of specialization in the pharmaceutical research that started in the late 90s. In fact, it is the continent with the highest and steadily increasing RCA index, which points out that Australia’s time as a pharma innovation power is most probably yet to come, and in the near future. Melbourne is Australia’s main life-sciences research hub and is primarily responsible for a robust growth of its pharmaceutical and other related industries. Australia is continuously ranked among the top five countries worldwide in biotechnology innovations, whose success stems from its “…educated population, strong academic institutions, favorable regulatory and R&amp;D environment and a supportive government” <a href = https://static.scientificamerican.com/wv/assets/2016_SciAmWorldView.pdf target = “_blank”>(Scientific American Worldview 2016, p.18)</a>. All in all, this analysis shows that the Swiss pharmaceutical sector, and, in particular the companies in the region of Basel, are still among the world leaders in innovation.</p>
<!--  In order to maintain this extraordinarily high level, international connectivity and access to global knowledge might be one crucial factor for the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland. These aspects are what we examine next. 

<br>

## **Knowledge Flows: Disentangling pharmaceutical patent citation networks**

<br>

How strongly connected are pharmaceutical innovations to other technologies? To investigate this question, we use so-called backward and forward citations of Swiss pharmaceutical patents across different technologies and geographical areas. The backward citations show which other technological fields might have inspired researchers in the Swiss pharmaceutical sector when they have developed new patents. Vice versa, forward citations indicate the technologies that have been influenced by inventions made in Swiss pharmaceutical labs.

As the first panel of the figure below shows, in the early 90s, new Swiss pharma patent applications drew knowledge from a very limited number of fields outside pharmaceuticals (medical technology (6%), measurement (3%), machinery (3%), organic chemistry (2%) and computer technology (1%)) and in a very limited scope. Swiss innovations in the pharmaceutical industry were predominantly pharmacentric, where 84% of all cited patents were classified as pharmaceutical technology. Hence, at the time, innovations in the Swiss pharmaceutical sector were apparently not much related to other technological fields. However, since the late 1990s, the sectoral citation network of Swiss pharma patents started its evolution in terms of both the extensive (number of different fields) and intensive margins (share of citations per field), reaching its peak in 2013, where only 43% of new pharma patents used solely the knowledge created by the pharmaceutical technology. The citation network shifted strongly towards biotechnology, depicting the ongoing fast-paced changes in the industry and fundamentally impacting its R&D activities. The knowledge inflow trends in the Swiss pharmaceutical innovations are comparable to those observed in the USA (you can see this by choosing the United States in the field *Choose a country* in the figure below). However, the use of biotechnology applications (the most important external knowledge source for pharmaceuticals today) became apparent somewhat earlier in US pharma patents than in other countries. This may have given the US firms a competitive edge over other regions, cementing their position as the world’s leading pharma innovation cluster of today.

As shown in the second panel of the figure below, the knowledge outflows (forward citations) of pharmaceutical innovations closely resemble the structure and trends observed in its knowledge inflows (backward citations). Hence, the scientific output of pharmaceuticals and other related fields, such as (among others) biotechnology and organic, medical or food chemistry, are highly complementary. For instance, this means that a strong pharmaceutical industry in a given region probably cannot exist without highly developed research centers in biotechnology and chemistry close by (such as in the region of Basel) and that the increase in the pharmaceutical sector’s innovation capacities may have a substantial multiplicative spillover effect on other industries. Through the entire period from 1990 to 2015, roughly 50% of Swiss pharma patents are cited from “outside”, i.e. by the new patent applications from technological fields other than pharmaceuticals. Nonetheless, by observing the recent knowledge flows among geographic entities, one notices that over 60% of both knowledge inflows and outflows regarding the Swiss pharmaceutical patents are linked to the USA, confirming the strong cooperation between the US and Swiss pharmaceutical companies also visible in the trade data.

See the previous box for information on patent data in general. In addition, backward citations are the number of patents that have been cited by patents of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry in a given year. All shown values are relative to the total backward citations of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry in a given year. We show only those technologies that have a share of at least 0.01 in a given year. We group them across technological fields and continents, where the technological field of the cited patent comes from <a href = https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/ipstats/en/statistics/patents/pdf/wipo_ipc_technology.pdf  target = “_blank”>WIPO</a>. Forward citations are the number of citations made to patents of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry. We again show shares and group them across technological fields and continents, where, as before, the citing patent's technology comes from <a href = https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/ipstats/en/statistics/patents/pdf/wipo_ipc_technology.pdf  target = “_blank”>WIPO</a>. For both plots, the citations of group "all" cover foreign and domestic patents of all technology fields.

<p>Let us conclude with a few takeaways. As our short outline shows, the Swiss pharmaceutical industry is one of the most important pillars of the Swiss economy. In addition to a growing number of employees and very high labor productivity, this is reflected in steadily increasing exports to the whole world. Innovations are crucial to ensure that this remains so in the future. With this in mind, it is very important to note that pharmaceutical firms located in Switzerland continue to be one among the world’s leading innovators. Therefore, it seems quite likely that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to contribute substantially to the economic prosperity of Switzerland.</p>
